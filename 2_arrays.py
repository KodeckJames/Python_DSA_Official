# Example: Say you are storing Apple's stock prices for 5 days 
stock_prices=[297, 330, 559, 785, 906]
# Scenario 1: Looking for the stock price on day 3:
day_2_stock_price=stock_prices[2]
print(day_2_stock_price)
# The big O complexity of looking for an array element by index is O(1) meaning, it's a constant time operation.
